# ML-pure-python-and-sklearn

Following Supervised and Unsupervised algorithms are covered in this sklearn and pure python ML models-

## Supervised Learning
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Regression
- Lasso and Ridge regression (L1 and L2 regularization)
- Polynomial Regression
- Normal Equation
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- KNN
- Support Vector Machine

## CROSS VALIDATION TECHNIQUES
- K-fold CV
- Stratified K-fold CV
- Leave one out CV
- using train/test split
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridsearchCV RandomizedSearchCV and cross validation score

## Unsupervised Learning
- K means clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Principal Component Analysis

## Others
- Feature Engineering Encoding, standardization, scaling, etc
- Outlier Detection using Z-score, IQR, StandardDeviation and Percentile

All models have been developed using sklearn and few models are developed using pure python(using numpy) too. 
Naive Bayes, Boosting algorithms and algorithms that are not coded in pure python will be put in few days.

### 2 kaggle projects are also included in Full ML projects folder-
- Australia rain dataset project
- heart disease project
